###Project Title: Validate forms using React and Formik

###Description of Project
#####This repo contains the code necessary to validate an email and password field.

###How to run this project.
#####You can fork this repo to your GitHub account or you can copy and download the repo to your PC by clicking on the green code button and selecting Download ZIP
##### public/index.html (this is where the React app is located)
##### src/App.js (this is the main component of the React application. This is where the code for the app resides)
##### Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder  (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the files)
##### Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
##### Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

###Roadmap of future improvements:
##### I would like to add additional validation which includes minimum password length, valid characters and a confirm field.
